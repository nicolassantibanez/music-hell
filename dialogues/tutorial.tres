Welcome to Music Hell, now we'll tell how to play the game.
First\\: Moving
To move use WASD, W to go forward, S to go backwards, A to go left and D to go right.
Second\\: Shooting
To shoot, you need to hit the right or left note on the note catcher and move the mouse to the place you want to shoot at.
Third\\: Focus mode
If you press shift, the focus mode will activate which consist on the player getting slower to make more precise movements and the hitbox is visible so the player can dodge easily.
Fourth\\: Debuff and Mutiplier
If you hit notes in a row you'll get a mutiplier for your bullets, on the other hand if you miss many notes in a row you will get a debuff, meaning a significant slow down for quite a bit.

Would you like to start again or exit?
